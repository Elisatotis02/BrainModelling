# BrainModelling

This project explores the Wilson-Cowan model, a key framework in computational neuroscience for studying excitatory and inhibitory neural interactions. Using numerical integration (Euler method), it simulates brain activity, analyzes equilibrium points, and visualizes neural dynamics. Applications include modeling normal oscillations (alpha, beta, gamma waves) and simulating epilepsy-related patterns. Implemented in Python with SciPy and Matplotlib.
